    "[???] Welcome to Thomasville Salon! Do ya have an appointment, honey?",
    "[...] A smiling blonde-haired woman greets you from behind the front desk. You take a few minutes to introduce yourself. Her name is Pip.",
    "[...] She tells you she is familiar with Minnie, as they often worked together and sometimes would see each other outside of work.",
    "[Pippa Clements] Oh yeah, it's a real shame, Minnie's story. No one having found the killer and all. Gives me the creeps thinking it happened so close to home.",
    "[Pippa Clements] But Minnie didn't have any 'enemies', as you say. She was just a regular-schmegular young girl.",
    "[Pippa Clements] Ya know she was tellin' me a couple weeks back now that she was going through a rough patch with her boyfriend... think his name is Kallum? But she was just mentioning she wasn't sure where that was going to go and wanted some advice.",
    "[Pippa Clements] Oh and she was also always complaining about her downstairs neighbor. He's a super grouch. The stories she's told of him are just... I just know he's annoying, ya know?",
    "[...] After you find a way to excuse yourself, you head back outside. You have a few new options from here."
